84. 5:10:19 Buddy — Awesome Awesome
85. 5:13:24 Mac Miller — Loud (A Miller track was cut from the station that we don't have a name for. Taking into account most cut tracks are from 2012, I picked Loud off Macadelic. Fits the station really well)

88. 5:23:43 Chief Keef — Love Sosa (Whilst only confirmed by Chief Keef himself - who might have been lying, other songs of his did make it into the game. It could be his song was given the boot once he broke NDA. The track fits the game incredibly well either way)

Deleted songs from GTA Online:
Found in the 2023 GTA V source code leak was a log output of all the files found in the RPF archive of an early GTA Online: The Contract build, with a list of songs that did not appear on either the final versions of Radio Los Santos, MOTOMAMI Los Santos, or West Coast Classics. Only the file names are known; it is not known which artists performed the song or to which station the songs belonged, but some approximation based on the song names alone is possible:

92. 5:39:30 Fenix Flexin feat. D-Block Europe — From the Block (Because the name is so generic, this is the closest I've found, outside of Jennifer Lopez that is...)
93. 5:42:03 Chief Keef feat. A Boogie wit da Hoodie — Glory Bridge
94. 5:45:12 Freddie Gibbs feat. Big Sean & Hit-Boy — 4 Thangs
95. 5:47:14 Pacman Da Gunman feat. Richard Fisher — Spin Again (Not confirmed, it is only confirmed that the song called Spin Again has been cut from the game)
96. 5:49:57 Flipp Dinero — Leave Me Alone
97. 5:53:11 Chief Keef — It Ain't My Fault
