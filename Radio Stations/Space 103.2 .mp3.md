Deleted songs:
GTA V's trackID.gxt2 database, found on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, reveals more songs were planned to appear on the station but were not included in the final version, and additional songs, not mentioned in the trackID.gtx2 database, were discovered in an early build of GTA V on a PlayStation 3 development kit.

23. 1:32:20 Young and Company — I like What You're Doing to Me
24. 1:36:53 Rick James — You and I
25. 1:40:02 Randy Crawford — You Might Need Somebody
26. 1:44:03 Eugene Wilde — Gotta Get You Home Tonight
27. 1:49:34 George Benson — Give Me the Night
28. 1:55:03 The S.O.S Band — For Your Love (unconfirmed, the artist is confirmed to be cut from the game but their song is not known. I picked For Your Love off their 1983 record On the Rise, which also features Just Be Good to Me, a song from GTA IV. Considering a Loose Ends track from the same album that had a GTA IV track was cut, I figure they would've similarly chosen a song from this particular album)
29. 2:00:18 George Duke — Reach for It
30. 2:05:29 Ohio Players — Fopp (Wiki states it having been meant for The Lowdown 91.1, which is very unlikely, it is not suitable for this radio station and this song was added to the database along with other Space 103.2 songs)
31. 2:09:09 Fatback Band — I Found Lovin'
32. 2:14:22 Kleeer — Intimate Connection
33. 2:19:33 Con Funk Shun — Ffun
34. 2:23:51 Chic — Le Freak (Not listed, but can be heard in the jingles of the radio station, it is possible that this song was originally planned to be fully used in game)
35. 2:27:40 Funkadelic — One Nation Under a Groove
36. 2:35:20 Cameo — She's Strange
37. 2:40:23 The Whispers — Rock Steady
38. 2:45:07 Zapp — Be Alright
39. 2:49:56 Rick James — Mary Jane (Yes it was also in GTA Vice CIty Stories)
40. 2:54:57 Loose Ends — Slow Down
41. 2:59:43 Joe Tex — Loose Caboose
42. 3:04:34 Rufus & Chaka Khan — Ain't Nobody (Actually was cut from Los Santos Rock Radio, but more suitable for Space 103.2)

0:25:50 Dazz Band — Joystick
0:33:38 Central Line — Walking into Sunshine
