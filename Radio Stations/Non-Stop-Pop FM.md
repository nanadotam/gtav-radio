Deleted songs:
GTA V's trackID.gxt2 database, found on the PS3 and Xbox 360, reveals more songs were planned to appear on the station but were not included in the final version.

43. 2:44:25 Neon Trees — Animal
44. 2:48:08 Cobra Starship feat. Sabi — You Make Me Feel...
45. 2:51:38 Belinda Carlisle — Circle in the Sand [The song was later moved to Los Santos Rock Radio]
46. 2:55:35 Tears for Fears — Everybody Wants to Rule the World
47. 2:59:54 Miike Snow — Animal [Wiki states it as having been meant for Radio Mirror Park, which is wrong as its ID was added to the TrackID database 70 songs before any Radio Mirror Park songs were added]
48. 3:03:54 Wilson Phillips — Hold On
49. 3:07:33 Michael Jackson — Jam [Not entirely confirmed, but an unmistakeable interpolation of it can be heard in one of the Jack's Howitzer segments in the game]
50. 3:12:45 Jamiroquai — Love Foolosophy
51. 3:16:30 Olivia Newton-John — Physical
52. 3:20:20 Enrique Iglesias feat. Pitbull — I Like It
53. 3:24:21 Estelle feat. Kanye West — American Boy
54. 3:29:01 Kevin Rudolf feat. Lil Wayne — Let It Rock
55. 3:33:16 Duran Duran — Serious
56. 3:37:28 Seal — Future Love Paradise
57. 3:41:51 Timbaland feat. Keri Hilson & D.O.E. — The Way I Are
58. 3:44:54 Kylie Minogue — Surrender
59. 3:47:46 Supermen Lovers — Starlight [Ok so this might be a bit of an egrigious pick as this track's exclusion was an uncited rumor, but it fell right in place with the other French House tracks on the station. And it's a bop. So I decided to give it a pass]


And also the following songs was originally cut from the original version of the game on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but later added again in all other versions of the game:
0:30:43 Moloko — The Time Is Now
0:38:11 Robbie Williams & Kylie Minogue — Kids
0:57:29 Mike Posner — Cooler Than Me (Single Mix)
1:51:37 Sneaker Pimps — 6 Underground
2:02:49 The Black Eyed Peas — Meet Me Halfway
2:22:20 Morcheeba — Tape Loop
2:33:28 Cassie — Me & U [It was also cut from The Vibe 98.8 from GTA IV]
2:51:38 Belinda Carlisle — Circle in the Sand [But was moved from Non-Stop-Pop FM to Los Santos Rock Radio]

The wiki also also says that the song Duncan Sheik - She Runs Away was cut, but this song was added to the database along with other Los Santos Rock Radio songs, and the wiki also says that the song Sneaker Pimps - 6 Underground (Bluebottle Mix) was cut, but this remix would be more suitable for electronic radio stations like Soulwax FM or FlyLo FM.
